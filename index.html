    <h1>Escaped Prisoner</h1>
    <div class="starting-screen">
        <p>Your story begins as an adventurer who has found themselves in prison after your most recent escapade. A situation, however, you’re not unfamiliar with. Your years of adventuring have left you well equipped to make your escape… if you make the right choices. Speaking of choices… there is more than one way to make your escape. Some options are optimal, while others may lead to a less than happy ending. Make too many risky decisions, and your adventure could end tragically. Now go! Adventure awaits!</p>

    <div class="story card-one">You awake in your cell deep in the dungeon of a castle you were unsuccessful in robbing. In your cell you have saved a fork from your last meal which you might be able to bend into a crude lockpick. You wait until nightfall when the guards switch shifts, leaving less personnel to deal with. Once you have your moment you pick the lock and the gate swings open. Just down the hall there is a guard by the door. What will you do?

        <p>Option 1: Throw your lockpick fork as a distraction for the guard to leave the door to investigate.
        
        Option 2: Attack the guard with the fork and attempt to overtake him.</p>
        </div>
    <div class="story card-two">You throw your forkpick down the opposite hall and the guard takes the bait! You wait for him to pass by before making your break for the door. Once through the door you start to look for your way out. You see a room that may be an armory and a corridor that could be a servant’s wing.

        <p>Option 1: Take the corridor and look for an escape.
        
        Option 2: Inspect the armory for a weapon.</p>
        </div>
    <div class="story card-three">You take the guard by surprise and stab him in the back with your fork shiv, but it looks like it wasn’t immediately lethal! He puts up a struggle before you grab the dagger from his belt and drive it through his heart. Now roughed up with adrenaline pumping, you frantically search for your next option. You see a room that may be an armory and a hallway that looks like the closest way to the exit but may have another night guard or two watching.

        <p>Option 1: Risk your way to the quickest exit.
        
        Option 2: Inspect the armory for a weapon.</p>
        </div>
    <div class="story card-four">The corridor leads to the staff kitchen! You quickly grab a disguise as a worker. You inspect the area and see a back door for deliveries and another hallway that could be an exit.

        <p>Option 1: Back door.
        
        Option 2: Hallway.</p>
        </div>
    <div class="story card-five">You make your way down the hall and can see the exit! However, just as you’re about to reach it, two nightwatch guards turn the corner! It’s fight or flight and you don’t have much to fight with except an old fireball spell some sketchy wizard taught you years ago. But you do see a window that leads down to the castle moat! What will you do?

        <p>Option 1: Attempt the fireball spell.
        
        Option 2: Take your chances with the moat.</p>
        </div>
    <div class="story card-six">You go into the armory and find two of any adventurer’s favorite staples, a bow with arrows and some rope! You make your way out of the armory and start to look for the exit. You see a hallway that could be the quickest escape but may have some guards, and a ladder that goes to the top of a tower. What will you do?

        <p>Option 1: Take the hallway.
        
        Option 2: Take the ladder.</p>
        </div>
    <div class="story card-seven Ending1">As it turns out, you probably shouldn’t have put any faith in that wizard. The spell backfires leaving you and the guards in literal ashes. Your adventure ends here. YOU DIED.</div>
    <div class="story card-eight Ending2">Luckily you are able to escape! Unluckily, you have taken an arrow to the knee. You may have survived this one, but your adventuring days are over…</div>
    <div class="story card-nine Ending3">You make your way down the hall and can see the exit! However, just as you’re about to reach it, two nightwatch guards turn the corner! Luckily you stopped to grab that bow and you are able to put up a fight! You take the guards down with ease and make your escape but leave empty handed!</div>
    <div class="story card-ten Ending4">You take the ladder up to the tower and use your bow and rope to make a zipline across the moat and to safety! You go down as the legendary adventurer who escaped!</div>
    <div class="story card-eleven Ending5">The backdoor does indeed lead to a delivery drop off. You see the gate where it should be easy enough to slip by unnoticed. On your way out you snag a bag of gold from one of the delivery wagons, a good adventurer can’t leave empty handed! You make your escape out the gate and into the city and go down as the legendary escapee! </div>
