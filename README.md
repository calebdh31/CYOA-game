Title of game: Escaped Prisoner.

This is a choose your own adventure game with 5 possible endings.

I took inspiration from my favorite game genre, RPGs, to make my own first attempt in the form of choose your own adventure.

Here is a link to the game https://calebdh31.github.io/CYOA-game/


The game is simple, you press 'play' and you will be given your first story prompt.
You can select either Option 1 or Option 2 from each prompt to progress the story.
The game ends when your storyline reaches its conclusion.
If you want to try a different path/go for a different ending, you can select "Play Again" at the end of your run.
I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to complete this project.

Stretch goals: I plan on adding more interactive styling to the buttons and cursor changes.
I'd also like to see if I can animations or sounds to react to choices made.
Maybe some background music might be a nice touch as well. 
Last thing I had to end up scrapping was my health function which I'd like to expand the branches and endings to accomodate.
